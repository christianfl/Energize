## Features

- Track your meals including calories, macro- and micronutrients
- Use several databases, including:
  - Open Food Facts
  - Swiss Food Composition Database
  - USDA FoodData Central
- Create custom meals
- Search meals by product name, EAN, or just scan the EAN code
  - the EAN code of the first matching custom food will be used or
  - Open Food Facts will be searched if that database is activated and no matching custom food was found
- Get meal suggestions based on your last tracked meals
- Set targets for macro- and micronutrients including calculating them based on your personal details
- See your daily nutrition details
- Create an [encrypted backup](docs/backup-encryption/README.md) with WebDAV and restore it

## Build

This app is built with Flutter. You can get the current used SDK version under [submodules/flutter](submodules/flutter); this is also used to pin the correct Flutter dependency for automated F-Droid builds on new versions (tags).

1. Download and setup flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Clone repository: `git clone https://codeberg.org/epinez/Energize.git && cd Energize`
3. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Run build runner to generate types: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
5. Build and install: `flutter run`

## Test

Testing is at an initial stage right now. The goal is to create integration tests which automatically create different screenshots using all supported locales.

Run integration tests:

```
flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
```

This currently only saves one screenshot to:

```
fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/images/phoneScreenshots/test.png
```

## Contribute

As this app is still in an early stage, a few things have still to be developed. The app is usable but sometimes has rough edges.

You are very welcome to:

- Help translating via Weblate: [![Translation status](https://hosted.weblate.org/widgets/energize/-/energize/svg-badge.svg)](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/energize/)
- Create issues for
  - things not working as intended
  - feature requests

  Please have a look whether similar issues already exist in advance.
- Develop something
    - There is no written roadmap or code style guidelines yet
    - it's easier to reach out in advance if you want something to be merged later. :-)

## Donate

If you want to support the development by a donation, you are very welcome to do so! Creating this app is a lot of fun but also a very time consuming task and sometimes leads to little frustration...
