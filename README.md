## Contribute

As this app is still in an early stage, a few things have still to be developed. The app is usable but sometimes has rough edges. If you want to be a tester on Google Play, feel free to write me a message and include your Gmail-address.

At this development stage you are very welcome to:

- Create issues for things not working as intended

Translation via weblate hopefully coming soon.

## Donate 

If you want to support the development by a donation, you are very welcome to do so! Creating this app is a lot of fun but also a very time consuming task and sometimes leads to little frustration :-).
