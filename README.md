  - EAN, UPC, and custom barcodes for custom food are supported
- Get meal suggestions based on your last tracked meals
- Set targets for macro- and micronutrients including calculating them based on your personal details
- See your daily nutrition details
- Create an [encrypted backup](docs/backup-encryption/README.md) and restore it

## Build

This app is built with Flutter. You can get the current used SDK version under [submodules/flutter](submodules/flutter); this is also used to pin the correct Flutter dependency for automated F-Droid builds on new versions (tags).

1. Download and setup flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Clone repository: `git clone https://codeberg.org/epinez/Energize.git && cd Energize`
3. Install dependencies: `flutter pub get`
4. Run build runner to generate types: `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs`
5. Build and install: `flutter run`

## Test / Automated screenshots

The integration tests automatically create different screenshots using all supported locales with dark and light theme.

Run integration tests:

```
flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test.dart --target=integration_test/app_test.dart
```

This saves the screenshots to:

```
fastlane/metadata/android/<locale>/images/phoneScreenshots/<number>_<theme>.png
```

- Create issues for
  - things not working as intended
  - feature requests

  Please have a look whether similar issues already exist in advance.
- Develop something
    - There is no written roadmap yet
      - [milestones](https://codeberg.org/epinez/Energize/milestones) are an indicator
      - Open issues could also be used as a reference
    - There are no code style guidelines in place, hopefully the [linter rules](https://codeberg.org/epinez/Energize/src/branch/main/analysis_options.yaml) can assist
    - Using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for PRs would be wonderful
    - it's easier to reach out in advance if you want something to be merged later ðŸ˜Š

## Donate

If you want to support the development by a donation, you are very welcome to do so. Creating this app is a lot of fun but also a very time consuming task. Your donation helps to fill my coffee pot and makes sure my protein bars are filled up.
